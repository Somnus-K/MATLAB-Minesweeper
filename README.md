# MATLAB-Minesweeper
This repository is for CSCI-471 Group Final project in which we build a MATLAB GUI Interface for the classic game, Minesweeper.

How-To-Use:

1. Open up MATLAB in the program folder.
2. Run MineSweeper.m
3. Type the difficulty you want to choose.
4. Left-click to reveal a tile, if you reveal a mine you lose.
5. Right-click to place a flag on a tile that you suspect is a mine.
6. Once all **safe** tiles have been revealed you win the game.

**DISCLAIMER: Depending on the resolution of your monitor, typing
too large of dimensions for the board may cause the window to extend
outside your monitor's display making it unplayable. There is no safeguard
to make sure you aren't setting too large of a board.**
