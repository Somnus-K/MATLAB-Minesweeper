# MATLAB-Minesweeper
This repository is for the CSCI-471 Group Final project in which we build a MATLAB GUI Interface for the classic game, Minesweeper.

How-To-Use:

1. Open up MATLAB in the program folder.
2. Run MineSweeper.m
3. Type the difficulty you want to choose.
4. Left-click to reveal a tile, if you reveal a mine you lose.
5. Right-click to place a flag on a tile that you suspect is a mine.
6. Once all **safe** tiles have been revealed you win the game.
